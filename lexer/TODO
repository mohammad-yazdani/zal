1. Figure out why the f*ck `vim .` takes so long here


colorscheme changes:
1. Line highlight is gross, make it more elegant and easier on the eyes
2. Maybe change the C generic token color from while
3. Highlight placeholders
4. Distinguish between c keywords and user defined tokens (free vs free_blah)
5. Change function call colors from gross yellow/orange to some other color
