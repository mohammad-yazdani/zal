\section*{Nov 11}

This is my first document. I am attempting to build  the
lexing part of my compiler(zal).
\\\\
So far I have gotten to the conlcusion that I should
build a simple scanner first.
\\
- Scanner: Will basically just tokenize out of whitespace
    and takes the semi-colons and other stuff out. To make the
    code simple I have decided to make a multi-pass algorithm.
